## Test API

The purpose of this test suite is to try to understand how to design and use test APIs as described in
a post on [Clean Coder blog](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/03/03/TDD-Harms-Architecture.html):

The intention behind this is to see if we can decouple tests from the services themselves.
